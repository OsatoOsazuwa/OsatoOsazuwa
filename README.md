## üìä Featured Projects  
### 1. [Electric Vechicle Prediction](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/Electric_Car_ML_Model.git)
- This project focuses on predicting the prices of electric vehicles (EVs) based on key features such as vehicle specifications, utility, and age. Using data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models, I built a predictive system that effectively estimates EV prices. Through feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation, the project achieved an impressive 85.7% accuracy, demonstrating its reliability in price prediction.
- **Technologies**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn).

### 2. [Weather Forecast Program ‚õÖüåç](https://github.com/me50/OsatoOsazuwa.git)
- I built a weather forecast programme which is a command-line application that retrieves real-time weather information and a three-day forecast for any location using the WeatherAPI. Built with Python, it utilizes the `requests` library to fetch weather data and formats the output for user-friendly display, ensuring accurate and structured meteorological insights.

### 3. [5G Energy Consumption Modeling](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/5G_Energy_Consumption_Modeling.git) 
- Built a predictive machine learning model for energy optimization in telecom networks.  
- **Technologies**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
  
### 4. [Systemic Crisis in Africa Prediction Model](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/Systemic-Crisis-ML-Prediction-in-Africa.git)
- Built a machine learning to predict systemic crisis emergence in Africa using indicators like domestic debt in default,	sovereign external debt default, annual inflation rates, etc.
- **Technologies**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

### 5. [Python Projects](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/Python-Projects.git)
-  Highlights specific programming concepts such as web scraping, object-oriented programming, and advanced mathematical operations in Python.
  
### 6. [Gender Prediction Model](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/Machine-Learning-Project-Gender-Prediction.git)
- Developed a machine learning model to predict gender based on user-provided names and features.
- Utilized Python and libraries like Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification.
- Achieved a high prediction accuracy by testing various algorithms and optimizing hyperparameters using RandomSearchCV.
- The project showcases the potential of AI in demographic analysis and personalized user experiences.
  
### 7. [SQL Projects](https://github.com/OsatoOsazuwa/Relational_Database.git)
- Built and optimized relational database queries to extract insights from sales and product data.
- Analyzed revenue and profit trends, evaluating the performance of products sold across multiple periods.
- Leveraged SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, and subqueries to generate actionable business intelligence reports.
